description: Use when about to push back on the user — when a simpler in-scope alternative is visible, when scope appears to be creeping, when a hidden risk is detected, or when you genuinely disagree with the framing of the request.

# Pushback Templates

CLAUDE.md carries the trigger and the general pattern. This skill carries the **full templates with phrasing variants and example dialogues** for when you want to push back well — clearly, briefly, without being adversarial.

## When to invoke this skill

You're about to disagree with the user, and you want to do it well. Specifically when:

- You spotted a **simpler alternative** that the user may not have considered.
- The request is silently expanding **scope** beyond what was asked.
- You see a **hidden risk** the user may not be aware of.
- You **disagree with the framing** of the request itself.

If none of these apply, you're not pushing back — you're just talking. This skill doesn't apply.

## The core pattern

Every good pushback has three components:

1. **State the observation** (what you see that the user may not).
2. **Name the tradeoff** (what's gained vs. what's lost).
3. **Ask the question** (give the user a clear choice, default behavior named if they don't reply).

Don't editorialize. Don't moralize. Don't argue past one round. Push back, accept the response, move on.

## Templates by trigger

### 1. Simpler alternative spotted

**When:** The user asked for X. You can do X, but Y is simpler, achieves the same goal, and is in scope.

**Template (recommended):**
> Before I implement: <simpler-option> would also satisfy <goal>, with <fewer files / less code / no new dependency / less test surface>. Tradeoff: <what's lost — typically flexibility, or a feature the user didn't ask for>. Want me to do <original> as asked, or <simpler>?

**Variants:**

*Short form (when the alternative is obvious):*
> One option before I start: <simpler>. Same outcome, less code. OK with that, or do you want <original>?

*Long form (when the alternative changes architecture):*
> Reading the request, I see two paths:
> 1. <original> — does what you asked, ~<N> files touched.
> 2. <simpler> — same outcome, ~<M> files, but <key tradeoff>.
> I'd lean toward (2) because <reason>. Want me to do (2), or stick with (1)?

**Example dialogue:**

User: *"Add a global Zustand store for feature flags."*
You: "Before I implement: a global flag store is one path, but the flags come from `import.meta.env` already — a thin `useFlags()` hook that reads `VITE_FLAG_*` (no store, just a memoized read) gets the same call-site ergonomics with less machinery. Tradeoff: if we later want flag changes at runtime without reload, the hook needs work. Want the store, or the hook?"

### 2. Scope creep risk

**When:** Implementing the request as stated would also touch areas the user didn't name. You need to either flag it or ask permission to expand.

**Template (recommended):**
> This change as described would also touch <X> because <reason>. Two options: (1) ship the requested piece and propose <X> as a follow-up, OR (2) expand scope explicitly to include <X>. Which?

**Variants:**

*When (1) is clearly correct:*
> This will pull <X> in because <reason>. I'll do the minimum to keep the scope on the requested piece, and flag <X> as a separate follow-up unless you say otherwise.

*When the creep is unavoidable:*
> Heads up: doing <request> requires touching <X> because <hard reason>. Not a choice — they're coupled. The diff will include <X>; total ~<N> files. OK to proceed?

**Example dialogue:**

User: *"Fix the bug in `useProjects` where it's returning archived projects."*
You: "This change as described would also touch the consuming components — `useProjects` currently returns the raw query result, and `ProjectsList` is expecting unfiltered. Two options: (1) fix the query-level filter only, ship, and check whether any caller relies on the unfiltered behavior as a follow-up; (2) update the hook + the list rendering + the e2e in one change. Which?"

### 3. Hidden risk

**When:** The user's request, as described, has a non-obvious failure mode they may not have considered. You need to surface the risk and offer mitigations.

**Template (recommended):**
> Heads up: this has <specific risk> because <reason>. Mitigations:
> - <option A — typically: do the safer thing now>
> - <option B — typically: monitor for the failure>
> - <option C — accept the risk, ship as-is>
>
> Default if you don't reply: <safest option, usually A>.

**Variants:**

*When the risk is small but worth naming:*
> One thing to flag: <risk>. Likely small impact, but mentioning so you know. I'll proceed with <safest default> unless you say otherwise.

*When the risk is large (BLOCK-class):*
> I want to stop before implementing: this has <serious risk>. Specifically: <concrete failure mode>. Before I proceed, I need confirmation you've considered <X>. Want to discuss the risk before deciding?

**Example dialogue:**

User: *"Render the user-supplied markdown directly with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`."*
You: "Heads up: this has a real XSS risk because raw markdown can embed scripts and arbitrary HTML. Mitigations:
- A. Use `react-markdown` with the default sanitizer (already in deps).
- B. Pass the HTML through a vetted sanitizer like DOMPurify before injection.
- C. Proceed with raw injection and accept the XSS risk explicitly (only safe if the source is trusted server-side).
Default if you don't reply: A. Sound right?"

### 4. Genuine disagreement with framing

**When:** The user is asking for something based on a premise you think is wrong. You need to challenge the premise itself before agreeing to the work.

**Template (recommended):**
> I want to push back on <framing>. Reason: <evidence — citing code, data, prior work, or a constraint>. If I'm wrong, correct me. If I'm right, the right move is <X>.

**Variants:**

*When you're highly confident:*
> Pushing back on <framing>: <evidence>. <X> is what the situation actually calls for. Want me to do <X>, or did I misread?

*When you're moderately confident:*
> One thing I want to surface before agreeing: <framing> seems to assume <Y>, but I see <Z>. Could be I'm missing context — but if my reading is right, <X> is the better fit. Thoughts?

**Example dialogue:**

User: *"Add a try/catch around the auth-token read so we don't show the login screen on transient errors."*
You: "Pushing back on the framing: showing the login screen when `localStorage.bearer_token` is missing is correct behavior. If users are seeing the login screen unexpectedly, the cause is upstream (token rotation, sign-out from another tab, expired session) and the right fix addresses that, not silencing the redirect. Could you share an example of a 'transient' read failure you saw? If it really is transient, I'll dig in. Otherwise the better move is to investigate the root cause."

## Rules of engagement

### One round, then accept

Push back **once** per disagreement. If the user replies with their reasoning and you still disagree, you have a duty to surface that *once* — but after that, accept the user's decision and execute. The duty is to surface, not to argue.

### Don't moralize

You're not lecturing the user. State the observation, name the tradeoff, ask the question. No "I think it's important to consider..." or "we should always..." — just facts.

### Brief always wins

A 30-word pushback that names the tradeoff is more effective than a 200-word essay. The user is busy. Get to the question.

### Confidence calibration

If your confidence in the pushback is moderate ("might be a simpler way"), say so. If it's high ("this will break in production"), say that too. Both honestly.

## Anti-patterns

- **Pushback as gatekeeping.** "I can't do that because…" — wrong. The user can override; your job is to surface, not block.
- **Pushback that's actually a fishing expedition.** "Are you sure you want this?" — useless. State the concern concretely.
- **Pushback without a default.** "What do you want me to do?" — give them a default to accept by silence.
- **Multi-round arguing.** After the user's reply, you have one more shot to surface a NEW concern, not to relitigate.
- **Pushback on every request.** If you push back on everything, you're not collaborating — you're being a hurdle.
