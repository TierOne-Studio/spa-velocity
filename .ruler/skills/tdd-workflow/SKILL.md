# TDD Workflow

Strict test-driven development. This is a workflow expectation, not a runtime hook: write or update a test first, verify it fails for the right reason, then make the minimal code change to pass it. If a change cannot follow TDD, the response MUST include one of the four valid waiver phrases at the bottom of this file.

## Anti-pattern: horizontal slicing (write all tests, then all code)

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** That treats RED as "draft every test" and GREEN as "draft every code path", which produces brittle tests:

- Tests written in bulk test *imagined* behavior, not *actual* behavior the code surfaced.
- They test the *shape* of things (signatures, data structures) instead of user-visible behavior.
- They become insensitive — they pass when behavior breaks and fail when behavior is fine.
- You commit to test structure before you understand the implementation.

**Correct: vertical slices via tracer bullets.** One test → one implementation → next test. Each test responds to what the previous cycle taught you.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   t1, t2, t3, t4, t5
  GREEN: i1, i2, i3, i4, i5

RIGHT (vertical, tracer-bullet):
  RED→GREEN: t1→i1
  RED→GREEN: t2→i2
  ...
```

When `qa-validator` sees a PR where all tests landed in one commit before any implementation, it flags this as a HIGH coverage-quality finding.

## Step 1 — Failing test FIRST (tracer bullet)

- Write the test before the implementation. The test MUST fail when run, **for the right reason** (asserts the behavior you intend to add — not a syntax/import error).
- Verify the failure: run the test before writing implementation code.
- Cover edge cases and known regression paths in the same step where reasonable.
- **You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user (or the failure-mode-analysis enumeration) which behaviors are critical paths or complex logic vs which are speculative edge cases. Test the former; don't pad the suite with the latter.

## Step 2 — Minimal implementation

- Write the simplest code that makes the test pass.
- No speculative branches. No "while we're here" refactors. No abstractions for a single caller.
- If a new abstraction is needed, prove it with at least 2 concrete callers first.

## Step 3 — Run the FULL test suite

- After every code change, run the **entire** suite, not just the new test, unless the user has explicitly narrowed the scope.
- For changes touching auth, payments, sessions, or PII: run BOTH the unit suite AND the integration suite. Name them explicitly in the response.
- If a test cannot be run in the current environment, output the exact commands the user should run locally / in CI, and state which subsets ran here and why.

## Step 4 — Refactor only if needed

- In-scope only. Tests stay green at every step.
- If refactoring grows beyond the current task, stop and propose it separately.

## Step 5 — Mini self-review

Before declaring the change complete, verify (in order):
- **Requirement coverage.** Every requirement / acceptance criterion has at least one passing test or an explicit waiver.
- **Assumptions validated.** Every assumption stated up front is either confirmed by the code/tests or recorded as a known risk in the response.
- **Every changed line traces to the request.** No drive-by edits.
- **Errors are actionable** (typed, contextual, redacted). Use the framework's error/exception types per `repo-conventions`, not plain `Error`.
- **Backward compatibility preserved** unless the user explicitly told you otherwise.
- **Security / performance flags raised explicitly** when applicable: new auth surface, new external call, new SQL, new big-O hot path. If none apply, state "no security/perf flags raised."
- **Confidence ≥ 0.9** per the rubric in `CLAUDE.md` P8.1. If lower, revise the weakest area before declaring done.

The design-principles check is delegated to `design-review`; do not duplicate it here.

## Interaction with `design-review`

Use `tdd-workflow` *during* implementation. Use `design-review` *at the end*, before declaring complete. One focused pass each — do not interleave principle review with red/green/refactor cycles.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing tests after the implementation ("retroactive TDD")
- Asserting on internals instead of observable behavior
- Mocking the unit under test
- Skipping the failure verification step
- Calling a try/catch a "fix" when the underlying logic is wrong
- Adding retry logic instead of fixing the root cause

## Test quality rubric

A test that *passes* is necessary; a test that's *good* is what catches regressions and lets you refactor without fear. Every test you write must satisfy:

1. **Asserts observable behavior, not internals.** Don't assert on private state, mock-call shapes, or implementation steps. Assert on what a caller would see — return values, side effects on shared state, emitted events, persisted data.
   - **Bad:** `expect(service.cache.get('x')).toBe(...)` — internal cache.
   - **Good:** `expect(await service.fetch('x')).toEqual(...)` — observable result.
   - **Diagnostic — the rename test:** if you rename an internal helper without changing its signature or behavior, every test should still pass. If a test breaks, that test was asserting on implementation, not behavior. Refactor the test before relying on it.

2. **Fails for the right reason.** Run the test BEFORE the implementation. It must fail because the assertion isn't satisfied — not because of an import error, missing mock setup, or syntax error. If the test "fails" before you've written a line of code under test, you have a bad test.

3. **Deterministic.** Same input → same output. No `Math.random()`, no `new Date()` without a clock injection, no time-dependent ordering, no reliance on async event-loop ordering across tests.
   - **Bad:** `expect(items).toEqual([a, b, c])` when the underlying code returns them in non-deterministic order.
   - **Good:** `expect(items).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining([a, b, c]))` or sort first.

4. **Named for the behavior.**
   - **Bad:** `it('works')`, `it('test 3')`, `it('should be fine')`.
   - **Good:** `it('returns 403 when user is in a different org')`, `it('rolls back the transaction when downstream call fails')`.

5. **One assertion per behavior.** A test failure should tell you exactly what broke. Multiple assertions are fine if they all describe one behavior; not if they describe four. If you're testing four things, write four tests.

6. **Minimal setup.** If setup is longer than the assertion, the unit under test probably has too many collaborators. Reconsider the design (this is a `design-review` smell). Setup-heavy tests rot fast.

7. **No mocking the unit under test.** If you have to mock parts of the thing you're testing, the unit's collaborators are misshapen. Refactor before testing.
   - **Mock at system boundaries only.** External APIs (Stripe, OpenAI, email, third-party HTTP), time/randomness, the file system. NOT your own classes or internal collaborators — those should be exercised through real code paths.
   - **Prefer SDK-style interfaces over generic fetchers.** A boundary client with one method per operation (`api.getUser(id)`, `api.createOrder(data)`) is independently mockable per call. A single `api.fetch(endpoint, options)` forces conditional logic inside the mock — fragile, slow to debug. When you write code to talk to a boundary, design the SDK shape first.

8. **No conditional logic in the test.** No `if`/`for`/`switch` in test bodies — those make the test a second implementation that itself can be wrong. Use parameterized tests (`it.each(...)`) instead.

9. **Tests one error path explicitly.** For every non-trivial failure mode (validation failure, downstream timeout, conflict, scope mismatch), have a test that triggers it and asserts on the surfaced error. "It should throw" is not enough — assert on the *kind* of error.
   - **Bad:** `expect(() => fn(bad)).toThrow()`.
   - **Good:** assert on the framework error type the code surfaces (e.g., a thrown `Error` with a specific message, an HTTP status, an error-boundary fallback rendering, a toast call). See `repo-conventions` for which surface this codebase uses.

10. **Lives next to the code, named consistently.** Match the project's convention for test file location and suffix. If the codebase uses `*.spec.ts`, don't introduce `*.test.ts`.

A test that meets all 10 is genuinely useful. A test that fails any is a *liability* — gives false confidence, slows refactoring, fights the engineer.

When `qa-validator` reviews your tests, this is the rubric it will apply.

## Waiver phrases (the only four valid)

If the change genuinely doesn't require a test, include exactly one of these in the response:

```
TDD waived — non-code change.
TDD waived — type-only.
TDD waived — config change with no behavior impact.
TDD waived — ADR-only change.
```

The `ADR-only change` waiver applies when the PR is exclusively `docs/decisions/ADR-NNN-*.md` content (rationale, alternatives, consequences) with no executable-code change. The moment the same PR also touches code, the waiver does not apply — the code part needs tests like any other change.

Forbidden non-waivers: "small change", "obvious fix", "trivial", "just a refactor".
