# SPEC-NNN: <Human Title>

## 1. Summary (intended behavior)

One paragraph: what the system should do after this change, from the user's perspective.

## 2. Context & problem

Why this change exists — the need/incident/request that prompted it. What's wrong or
missing today. Cite files where the constraint is visible.

## 3. Scope

**In scope:** <bullets>

**Out of scope / non-goals:** <bullets — explicit, so reviewers don't expect them>

## 4. Assumptions

Numbered; each gets a status. Wrong ones are struck and corrected in place.

1. [Confirmed|Unconfirmed|Corrected] <assumption>
2. ...

> Correct any Unconfirmed assumption now, or implementation proceeds on it.

## 5. Affected areas

Files / modules / routes / RBAC scopes / API contracts / schema. Keep aligned with the real diff.

- `src/features/<Feature>/...`
- Routes / guards: ...
- API endpoints consumed: ...

## 6. Acceptance criteria (falsifiable; each maps to a test)

| # | Criterion (observable behavior) | Proving test (file:line) |
|---|---|---|
| AC1 | <e.g. "Returns 403 when user is in a different org"> | <unit/e2e path> |
| AC2 | ... | ... |

## 7. Implementation plan

3–8 steps (mirrors plan-mode). Each: `files:` / `tests:` / `risk:` / `slice:`.

## 8. Testing plan

Which layer proves which AC — unit/component (Vitest + Testing Library), e2e (Playwright `e2e/<module>/`).
Name the test files.

## 9. Risks & failure modes

Null/empty/large/race/partial/network/malformed/boundary as relevant; mitigation per risk.

## 10. Open questions

Unresolved items blocking or shaping the work.
